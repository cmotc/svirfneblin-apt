Description: A Gnome3-Like configuration for Awesome WM
 I like Gnome3's appearance, but I want tiling and I hate ShellShape,
 and I don't think I really need  all these graphical configuration
 tools, and I really don't think I need any more javascript in my life
 than absolutely necessary. Seriously guy's, this is getting out of
 hand. Maybe it's not my place, but I'm just sayin'. Well technically
 not just sayin'. I'm doin', as in re-implementing this stuff I like
 about Gnome in a language that doesn't make me seasick to look at.
 .
 This package contains the custom configuration, session, and a laucher
 which checks for the correct config without touching the default
 Awesome WM config for Debian, which is treated as a fallback.
